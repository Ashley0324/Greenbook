## 👋 Brief
The concept of a network state has been proposed for two years. In exploring DAOs, we have found that there is high-frequency mobility among members of DAOs, as well as cooperation and rivalry between different DAOs. A large number of interconnected DAOs will constitute these network states, bringing more people into a fairer world on the blockchain.
