## 👋 Brief
The concept of a network state has been proposed for two years. In exploring DAOs, we have found high-frequency mobility among members of DAOs and cooperation and rivalry between different DAOs. Many interconnected DAOs will constitute these network states, bringing more people into a fairer world on the blockchain. Now we have built more than 70,000 members community, and the next step is to build a network state to make them enjoy the online life.
